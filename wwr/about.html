            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Dykes company was started during the 20th centuary by a person known as Dandyke. Dan the founder was not
                able to establish a good place for tourist to come and have fun due to financial issues. He later went
                to nearby bank and asked for a loan which would help him start a hotel around the river. Using the loan
                he build a beautiful structure along the river and bought two boats which were too small ony to
                accomodate two people per trip. 10 years later he repaid his loan through the business and grew by
                buying other advanced costumes and equipments in addition he build many more beautiful structures like
                the sweeming pools and others. later in the year 2020 he registerd his business as a company in his
                government as the Dykes company. </p>
