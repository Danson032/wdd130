            <h2>History</h2>
            <div class="history-grid">
                <p>Dykes company was started during the 20th century by a person known as Dandyke. Dan the founder was
                    not
                    able to establish a good place for tourists to come and have fun due to financial issues. He later
                    went
                    to nearby bank and asked for a loan which would help him start a hotel around the river. Using the
                    loan
                    he built a beautiful structure along the river and bought two boats which were too small only to
                    accommodate two people per trip. 10 years later he repaid his loan through the business and grew by
                    buying other advanced costumes and equipment in addition he built many more beautiful structures
                    like
                    the swimming pools and others. Later in the year 2020 he registered his business as a company in his
                    government as the Dykes company.
